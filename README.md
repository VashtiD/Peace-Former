    <h1>Snake Adventure Game</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Snake Adventure Game! In this exciting game, you find yourself in a dark room filled with treasures and sneaky snakes. Your goal is to collect treasures while avoiding the snakes for at least 10 seconds. If you touch a snake, it's "Game Over!" But if you successfully avoid them, "You Win!"</p>

    <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Use the arrow keys on your keyboard (up, down, left, right) to move your player around the screen. The faster you move, the easier it will be to avoid the snakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Collecting Treasures:</strong> You can collect treasures that appear in the rooms. When you move over a treasure, it will disappear, and your score will increase.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoiding Snakes:</strong> Be careful! If you touch a snake, the game ends, and you'll see "Game Over!" on the screen. If you stay away from the snakes for 10 seconds, you'll win!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start the game and read the instructions on the screen.</li>
        <li>Use the buttons to navigate between different rooms:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Go North:</strong> Enter the treasure room where you can find treasures to collect.</li>
                <li><strong>Go East:</strong> Enter the snake room, where you need to avoid the snakes for 10 seconds.</li>
                <li><strong>Examine Room:</strong> This option won't allow you to progress but lets you explore what's in the dark room.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Move your character using the arrow keys and try to collect as many treasures as you can while avoiding the snakes.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the timer! It counts down from 10 seconds when you enter the snake room.</li>
    </ol>
